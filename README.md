# 🧮 Scientific AI Calculator Application

### A Cross-Platform AI-Powered Math Helper

Developed using **Flutter**, this application combines a **calculator**, **AI assistant (ChatGPT integration)**, and planned **voice input** to make mathematics more interactive and accessible for students.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Math Assistant App** is designed to help users — particularly tertiary students — solve mathematical problems in a more intuitive and engaging way.
It provides:

* A **fully functional scientific calculator** for arithmetic and advanced functions
* Integration with **ChatGPT API** for **conceptual math questions** and **step-by-step explanations**
* (Upcoming) **Voice Input** using Google’s **Speech-to-Text API**
* (Upcoming) **Photo Recognition (PhotoMath)** to solve equations directly from images
