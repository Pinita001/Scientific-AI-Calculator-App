## A Cross-Platform AI-Powered Math Helper

## 🚀 Overview
The **Scientific AI Calculator App** is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter.  
It combines a full scientific calculator with AI-powered explanations using the **ChatGPT API**.  
Designed as a Final Year Project (FYP), the app supports tertiary students by providing both computations and conceptual reasoning.

## 🧰 Features

### ✅ Implemented

* **Local Calculator Engine**

  * Supports basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`)
  * Includes scientific functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `log`, `ln`, `exp`
  * Degree/radian mode toggle

* **ChatGPT API Integration**

  * Handles conceptual and word-based math problems
  * Provides explanations and reasoning

* **Cross-Platform UI**

  * Built with **Flutter**, optimized for both **iOS** and **Android**
  * Clean, responsive interface with a light-themed calculator layout

### 🧩 In Progress

* **Speech Recognition Module**

  * Microphone interface added
  * Google Speech-to-Text integration in development

* **PhotoMath-Style Recognition**

  * Planned for future implementation using image-to-text processing
